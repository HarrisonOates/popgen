# POPGEN

Methods for deordering and reordering partial order plans.

## Disclaimer
This code is from half-a-decade ago, and is in need of some serious updating. This will likely come in the form of a rewrite using libraries such as [[bauhaus](https://github.com/qumulab/bauhaus)], but until that time please be aware that things may no longer be working with modern libraries.

## Usage
Coming soon.

## Requirements
Coming soon.
